# SpacEscape2D
#### Created by Abheek Dhawan
SpacEscape2D is a simple 2D game centered around controlling a rocket while avoiding asteroids. It was created using the `Godot Engine` and is the newer version of a 3D game I made in the `Unity Engine`.

#### Current and planned supported operating systems:
- [x] HTML
- [x] Linux
- [x] macOS
- [X] Windows
- [ ] Android
- [ ] iOS
- [ ] Raspberry Pi (deb)

## TODO
Currently the game is lacking a few features which are still in development:
- ~~Game saves~~ Game saves have been added! They currently store coins, but storing the hi-score is still a work-in-progress.
- Coins/currency
- Powerups
I am also working on a "story mode," which incorporates different powerups and such and works kind of like a step-by-step introduction to all of the elements in the game (most of which have not been added yet). I am also trying to figure out a workflow in which I can add a `beta` branch to `GitHub` in order to introduce some new features beforehand so that they can be tested out.

# Thanks for checking out my game!
